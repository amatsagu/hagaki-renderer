### The fun and casual card collecting Discord app.

Kikuri brings a fresh, dynamic, and community-driven anime gacha experience to your server. Collect, trade, upgrade, and battle — all within a globally connected economy. Whether you're a collector at heart, a savvy trader or a strategic duelist, Kikuri offers something engaging for everyone.

Perfect for newcomers, seasoned collectors, and competitive players alike — we're dedicated to delivering features that allow you to play in multiple ways. Additionally, Kikuri is one of the few Discord bots/apps that **does not** rely on a print system to define a card's rarity or age. We believe that when something rare is pulled, it should always feel special.

### ✨ Notable features
- 🐣 **A fresh start** – We're putting a new spin on well-known mechanics from other anime gacha or RPG/tactical games. Kikuri doesn’t follow the same well known formulas — we aim to build our own identity and value.

- 🪽 **Breath of RPG elements** – Each KCG card comes with its own stat panel (and future skills) that influence most activities. Worth mentioning are: Kirigan battles, dungeon diving, and node exploration. ᡣ𐭩

- 🏆 **Achievements & completion lists** – Track your progress, collect milestones, and compete with friends, clans, or servers in the global economy for those bragging rights ...and maybe more? ᡣ𐭩

- 🎴 **Multi-layered card customization** – Frames? Colors? Particles or special effects? Still not enough? You can even upload your own custom card images to create something truly unique! *(rules apply)*

- 🚫 **No #print shenanigans** – Cards don’t come with print numbers or artificial rarity padding. If you pull a rare card — it’s rare, period. As it should be.

- ⛵️ **Seasonal and themed events** – Dive into the excitement of limited-edition card, frame, and item releases. We’re always trying to work on a new & exciting mechanics that could bring a fresh moments of joy to your journey. ᡣ𐭩

- 🧭 **Activities/Minigames** – Enjoy a mix of permanent and time-limited minigames and side activities, especially during events. ᡣ𐭩

- ⚖️ **Fair Play** – Kikuri stays true to F2P values. No premium currency, no pay-to-win items or advantages — just fair, rewarding progression for everyone. To keep things safe and balanced, our moderation team monitors suspicious behavior and trades - backed by a smart anti-cheat system. We also enforce strict anti cross-trading or real-money trading policies while continuously evaluating the state of the global economy.

ᡣ𐭩 – *These elements are still in development or stay temporarily limited while we focus on other areas. Kikuri is a passion-driven project, built by our community — for our community. Progress might sometimes feel slower compared to larger bots, but we're here! - taking our time to ensure everything feels polished, meaningful, and enjoyable.*
